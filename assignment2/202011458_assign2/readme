1. While doing this assignment, I only received help with the basic grammar of the C language (pointers, how to write functions) through internet searches
2. It took a total of 2 days to complete this assignment.
3. Through this assignment, I learned how to open and close a directory in a C language program, and learned that the properties of a directory or file can be retrieved through the 'lstat' function.

<processDir Algorithm>
1. The directory is opened using 'opendir'. If it fails to open, an error message is printed and the function exits.
2. The 'getNext' function is used to iterate through directory entries, counting the number of entries. This count is used to allocate an array for the entries.
3. The directory is reopened with 'opendir', and each entry is stored in an array. The entries are then sorted using 'qsort'.
4. For each entry, The file name is truncated if necessary or kept as is. A full path is constructed, and 'lstat' is used to retrieve file information. If an error occurs while retrieving file information, an error message is printed; otherwise, statistics are updated.
5. The type of file is identified and printed. Depending on the flags, the function either prints the entries in tree view or simple mode. If the F_VERBOSE flag is set, additional file details such as owner, group, size, and blocks are printed.
6. If an entry is a directory, the function recursively calls 'processDir' to process the subdirectory.
7. After processing all entries, the directory is closed using 'closedir'.
